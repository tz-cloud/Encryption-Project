The old radio on the windowsill crackled to life just as the afternoon sun dipped behind the neighbor’s crooked fence. No one in the house remembered plugging it in, but there it was, humming an unfamiliar melody that sounded like a lullaby played backward. A stray cat paused on the porch as if listening, its tail twitching with curiosity.

Inside, the scent of fresh oranges drifted through the kitchen even though the fruit bowl had been empty for days. It mingled with the faint aroma of rain on warm pavement, creating a strangely comforting atmosphere. Someone had left a half-finished crossword puzzle open on the table, and every time the radio changed stations, a new word seemed to appear in the blanks as if filled in by an invisible hand.

Outside, the first stars blinked awake, scattering themselves carelessly across the sky. The cat finally nudged open the door and strolled in, circling the radio before curling up beside it like an old friend. The melody softened, the room grew still, and for a moment it felt as though the entire world was holding its breath, waiting for something wonderful or wonderfully weird to happen.
